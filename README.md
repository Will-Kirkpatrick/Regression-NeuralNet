# Regression-NeuralNet
This is a repository for some of the code I worked on outside of my chemistry research.

The regression neural network is trained on a sine curve, with the prediction data plotted alongside the training data.

The neural nets were developed following the NNFS textbook; thanks to Harrison Kinsley.
